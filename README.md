# Generation of atmospheric cloud fields using GANs:

This repository contains the Python code used by Rebecka Rilemark and Carl Svensson to develop two generative adversarial networks (GAN and CGAN) for generating atmospheric cloud fields (CloudSat scenes) from MODIS data.

The package requirements are found in the code, including NumPy, PyTorch and matplotlib. A GPU is recommended for the training of the networks. 

The data sets can be found at the ICARE Data and Services Center.
